#Todo App 
This application was written using BackboneJS & Handlebars Templating. The idea was originally concieved from http://todomvc.com/ 
I wanted to learn a few new technolgies so I teh examples as a template for writting my own interpretation of TodoMVC.
 
###Project Goal(s)
The goal of this project is to learn and play with several new technologies. To get specific, I started a new gig with a 
couple projects in maintenance and a couple that will be using some newer technology. The projects to be maintained and 
slowely improevd use backbone, handlebars, require, grunt, and several other libraries.

I hadn't used either in previous positions so I decided to learn these technologies. Outside of theoretics, I find getting 
my hands dirty with the tech is the quickest way to truely learning and understanding the tools. I compliment the experience 
with reading to enhance my level of understanding. Reading material generally includes, MDN, documentation, and blog posts, 
podcasts & webcasts from the language/tooling authors, and of course, jumping directly into the source code.
