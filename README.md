#Todo App 
This application was written using BackboneJS & Handlebars Templating. The idea was originally concieved from http://todomvc.com/ 
I wanted to learn a few new technolgies so I teh examples as a template for writting my own interpretation of TodoMVC.

###Project Goal(s)
The goal of this project is to learn and play with several new technologies. To get specific, I started a new gig with a 
couple projects in maintenance and a couple that will be using some newer technology. The projects to be maintained and 
slowely improevd use backbone, handlebars, require, grunt, and several other libraries.

I hadn't used either in previous positions so I decided to learn these technologies. Outside of theoretics, I find getting 
my hands dirty with the tech is the quickest way to truely learning and understanding the tools. I compliment the experience 
with reading to enhance my level of understanding. Reading material generally includes, MDN, documentation, and blog posts, 
podcasts & webcasts from the language/tooling authors, and of course, jumping directly into the source code.

###Technologies
This project uses a mix of different tech including:

- backbone
- handlebars

*(WIP)*

- require
- grunt

###Setup
*(WIP)*

1. Copy or clone project to computer.
1. Install the Node dependencies. Generally, that just means running `npm install` from the repository directory.
1. Because this project doesn't have a build process, you will need to manually copy some of the libraries in the `js/libs` folder (yup manually). Copy the following:

    1. jquery.slim.min.js
    1. underscore.min.js
    1. backbone.min.js
    1. backbone-nested.js
    1. backbone.localStorage.js
    1. handlebars.js

1. Once that tedius task is complete, you should be able to point your browser to the index.html and see the application in action!
